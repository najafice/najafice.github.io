My name is Abolfazl. I am a Civil and Geotechnical engineer from Iran. I was born in [Isfahan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isfahan) in 1997 and am now working in the beautiful city of [Bandar Abbas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandar_Abbas), near the Persian Gulf.

I have about two years of experience in the design and supervision of various geotechnical and structural projects. My expertise extends across a variety of technical software and programming languages, including PLAXIS (2D, 3D), GeoStudio, SAP2000, and Python (numpy, pandas, mpl and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)).

In the academic world, my research interests include soil-structure interaction (SSI), soil improvement, offshore geotechnics, and the application of machine learning in natural hazard problems (i.e. earthquakes and landslides).

Apart from engineering, I also have a passion for trading stocks and [indices](https://www.investing.com/indices). The economy and financial markets are among my favorite areas to study and gain experience in. Additionally, going to the gym, swimming, and hiking are my favorite exercises.
