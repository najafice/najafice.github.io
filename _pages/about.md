My name is Abolfazl. I am a Civil and Geotechnical engineer from Iran. I was born in Esfahan in 1997 and am now working in the beautiful city of Bandar Abbas, near the Persian Gulf.

I have two years of experience in the design and supervision of various geotechnical and structural projects. In the academic world, my research interests include soil-structure interaction (SSI), soil improvement, offshore geotechnics, and the application of machine learning in natural hazard problems.

Apart from engineering, I also have a passion for trading stocks and indices. The economy and financial markets are among my favorite areas to study and gain experience in. Additionally, going to the gym, swimming, and hiking are my favorite exercises.
