My name is Abolfazl. I'm a Civil and Geotechnical engineer from Iran. I was born in Esfahan in 1997 and am now working in the beautiful Bandar Abbas near the Persian Gulf. My current research interests are soil-structure interaction (SSI), soil improvement, offshore geotechnics, and the application of machine learning in natural hazard problems.
